    <section><p>i started making stuff for the web around 2017, when i first learned how to code. what struck me the most was how complex everything felt. one day, the people who introduced me to it were using PHP and MySQL. the next, they had switched to Vue and Bootstrap, with a build step just to make a frontend for a chat app built with Node, Express, and MySQL - something they could’ve made entirely in PHP.
it made no sense to me. they could’ve just used jQuery and PHP, which is what i was learning at the time. it felt overwhelming for no reason. honestly, that might’ve been my first childhood tech trauma.</p>
<p>meanwhile, i was more into game development, and i stuck with it. i didn’t really know why back then, but now i do.
with game engines, you’re given tools for rendering, logic, and even hosting—everything follows a stable philosophy, with consistent patterns and a clear way to do things.</p>
<p>fast forward a few years, i’ve learned a bunch of languages for both web and general-purpose development. and while i’m comfortable with most of them, i still feel way more confident using Godot than Go. the difference is, with Godot, i know exactly what i need to learn and where to look.</p>
<p>that’s a big reason why i prefer monolithic or battery-included stacks over modular ones. with monoliths, the path is laid out. you know where you’re going, and you can find your way back. with modular stacks, it feels like you’re constantly choosing between ten different paths that all go in opposite directions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An ant doesn&rsquo;t start babbling when they see a circuit board. They find it strange, to them it is a landscape of strange angles and humming monoliths. They may be scared, but that is not madness.</p>
<p>Madness comes when the ant, for a moment, can see as a human does.</p>
<p>It understands those markings are words, symbols with meaning, like a pheromone but infinitely more complex. It can travel unimaginable distances, to lands unlike anything it has seen before. It knows of mirth, embarrassment, love, concepts unimaginable before this moment, and then&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ant again.</p>
<p>Echoes of things it cannot comprehend swirl around its mind. It cannot make use of this knowledge, but it still remembers. How is it supposed to return to its life? The more the ant saw the harder it is for it to forget. It needs to see it again, understand again. It will do anything to show others, to show itself, nothing else in this tiny world matters.</p>
<p>This is madness.</p></blockquote>
