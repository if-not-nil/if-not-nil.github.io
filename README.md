# if you use my template, please let me know! i'd like to see what you do with it

whole thing is based on heavily modified [lugo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo) and [new.css](https://newcss.net/)

important things to note:
- make posts as bundles to keep it consistent
- put all you gotta put into index.html
