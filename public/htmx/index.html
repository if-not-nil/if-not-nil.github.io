<p>when they go low, i go lowER</p></blockquote>
<p>a long, long time ago, HTML was made. it was supposed to be simple - just documents with information and links to other documents. then someone added <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, which let pages submit requests to the server. and then they just kind of stopped?</p>
<p>so the community stepped in. layer after layer of tools and frameworks were added to extend HTML&rsquo;s limited interactivity. eventually, your HTML markup became just a small slice of what makes up the modern frontend. that works, sure - but wouldn’t it be cooler if you could interact with your backend <strong>without</strong> JavaScript?</p>
<p>enter <a href="https://htmx.org">htmx</a>, which uses javascript so you don’t have to.</p>
<p>i read their manifesto (which they call a book for some reason), and what hit me the hardest was how it described modern client-server interaction: the client sends a request, the server responds with JSON, the client parses that JSON, turns it into HTML, and re-renders a chunk of the page—often way more than necessary.</p>
<p>i used to think htmx was pretty much the same thing as alpine.js. but after reading that, i finally saw the difference: htmx skips the middleman. it lets the server return <strong>HTML directly</strong>, removing the need for JSON wrangling on the frontend.</p>
<p>at first, i was deeply offended. just return HTML?
what about data reusability? what if i want to use that JSON on another platform?</p>
<p>then it hit me: i literally don’t need that
and if i ever do, i could easily tweak my code to support both. it’s not like i have hundreds of endpoints to maintain.</p>
<p>in fact, most of what i want to build could be written in PHP. and the <em>only</em> reason i don’t use php is because i don’t like the language - not because the way it works is wrong. philosophically, i’m fine with how php does things.</p>
<p>so what is the htmx way of doing things?</p>
<p>you pretend it’s the 90s. you don’t treat the web like it’s a native app—because it’s not. you lean into HTML. you get full pages, partials, fragments - just raw HTML from your server, like an alternate timeline where web dev stayed a hobbyist project for 10 more years instead of pivoting to app-building.</p>
<p>and honestly, i think it’s really beautiful to try a dish you hated in childhood and realize that now, you actually <em>love</em> it.</p>
