## `fl 808s outside of fl
i use like three daws all the time

the 2023+ sc ug signature sound happens because of how the 808's clipping affects every other part and aroudn the punch kinda. so thats what you wanna make sure you care about the most - layer it with snares, whatever

you wanna take your 808 and then u clip the fuck out of it 
it's binary, it doesn't hit if you don't clip it

the sound is like that because of the FL soft clipper. which is a soft clipper but also saturation and also some other waveshaper distortion

on reaper u can bravely add 8db to the sample itself (not the track) and whip on two saturators

## `linux
your audio will just work better with pipewire-jack and you won't have to emulate anything
- reaper as the daw and reapack extensions for fx
- surge xt, vital for synths
- look up the packages inside of arch's `pro-audio` group and vcv rack on the aur
- a lot of samples. reaper is even better than ableton with scripts (look up birdbird's scripts)

## `the 90s method
everyone used to make their stuff really quiet and then very suddenly very loud (listen to nirvana) but it actually sounds rly dynamic when you do so

i automate effects down and then up in this order
- distortion
- filter
- chromatic effects like saturators
- the eqs where you have low/high pass

when your bpm is high enough, the best thing will be completely muting and unmuting some tracks

## `the ocelot method
https://soundcloud.com/ocelotbruh
the only way i could do it like him (the top tracks) is by putting random samples on a grid like it's open hats, having a track with just hi hats, making sure they clip, sidechaining that to the track with samples and muting the hh track. not sure tho cuz its still not even that close
you can also do a sawtooth-ish automation on a 1khz+ sound and match it to a snare

## `the spectrogram method
enable spectrograms in reaper
i struggle with drums a lot so sometimes i'll pick any song (like, any) that is of matching BPM and just match drum elements to the distinct parts of the spectrogram. ends up being kinda good sometimes

## `sample gore method
so since i do half my stuff on linux+reaper, we dont have anything unless we emulate windows

u wanna slow something down and then mess with the timestretch mode and pitch. this is enough to make a pad out of anything if you also use some spectral shift plugin.

but if not, then u take the bites of the sound that u like, layer them with themselves but on a different warp mode (and eq each one differently) and then just glue them. also wanna use a saturator or any other spectral effect to glue it back together
