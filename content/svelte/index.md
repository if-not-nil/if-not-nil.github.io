**i dont remember when i wrote it but its here**

as someone who has only recently picked frontend frameworks (outside of htmx and alpine) up, i think svelte is a godsend    
i've tried some of them and every time there is this balance between functionality and performance   


svelte,  
on the other hand,   
lets you have both  

when comparing it to preact and solid, which are the only other ones i've had experience with, it performs about the same  
while at the same time allowing for the use of **stuff**
> "stuff" here means features for the developer, the clanker and the user

i'm a firm believer that frontend is hugely misrepresented  
there's this notion pushed by those who want maintainers and testers for their frameworks that web development is about technology, rather than putting **stuff** in **places**  
i think svelte is an effective placebo for getting rid of that - it gives you all the overhead you might and might not care about while keeping the bundle size as low as it can be
